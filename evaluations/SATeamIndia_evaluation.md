# SATeamIndia - Evaluation

## Project Overview

SATeamIndia's submission consists of a Mental Health Companion application that uses Agora's Conversational AI Engine. The project includes:

1. A React-based frontend client for real-time audio communication
2. A Node.js Express server to manage AI agents through Agora's Conversational AI API
3. Integration with OpenAI for natural language processing
4. Integration with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech

The Mental Health Companion provides users with an AI-powered conversational assistant focused on supporting mental well-being through evidence-based guidance and compassionate interaction.

## Scoring Details

### 1. Innovation

**Score: 4**

The project presents a good concept with some unique elements, the focus on mental health support with a specialized AI personality provides a good foundation for a meaningful real-world application.

### 2. Functionality

**Score: 4**

The implementation works well, The core functionality of connecting to an AI agent through Agora's RTC SDK is well-implemented.

### 3. Technical Execution

**Score: 3**

The code quality is good with a reasonable structure. The project demonstrates:

- Clean separation between client and server components
- Appropriate use of Agora's Conversational AI API
- Reasonable code organization

However, there are is one major area for improvement. Sending api keys (llm and tts keys) from the frontend is not a good practice, since you already have a backend, they should have been set from the backend.

### 4. Documentation & Testing

**Score: 4**

The documentation is comprehensive and well-structured. The project includes:

- Detailed README files for both client and server components
- Clear setup instructions and configuration options
- API endpoint documentation with request/response formats
- Descriptions of the AI personality and its capabilities
- Screenshots showing the application in use

The documentation makes it easy to understand the project's structure, and how to set it up, though local development instructions could be more detailed.

### 5. User Experience

**Score: 3**

The user interface is functional and meets basic user needs. It includes:

- Clean, minimalist design with good visual hierarchy
- Visual indicators for connection status and AI speaking activity
- Simple toggle switch for connecting/disconnecting

However, there are some issues with the execution. The application thrusts the user right into a channel where a request for mic permissions is shown as the page loads. The best practice is to have this triggered by a button click.

### 6. Real-World Impact

**Score: 4**

The project has a strong real-world use case with good potential impact. Mental health support is a significant global need, and making AI companions available for emotional support addresses meaningful needs. The specialized AI personality with evidence-based techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and positive psychology demonstrates understanding of the domain. The application could be valuable for users seeking immediate emotional support in moments of stress or anxiety.

## Bonus Point

**Score: +0**

The team did not incorporate additional Agora technologies beyond the required RTC implementation.

## Total Score

**Final Score: 3.6/5**

## Feedback

### Strengths

- Excellent documentation with comprehensive README files for both client and server
- Strong focus on a meaningful real-world application in mental health support
- Well-implemented core functionality with Agora's Conversational AI
- Good technical separation between client and server components
- Thoughtfully configured AI personality for mental health support

### Areas for Improvement

- Add more interactive features to enhance user engagement
- Implement user authentication and session persistence for continuity
- Consider accessibility features for broader inclusivity
- Add local development instructions with step-by-step setup guide
- Provide more visual feedback or history of the conversation
- Implement additional Agora technologies for enhanced functionality

### Additional Comments

The Mental Health Companion demonstrates a practical application of Agora's Conversational AI technology for supporting emotional well-being. With its specialized AI personality and focus on evidence-based techniques, it shows how voice-first AI can provide meaningful support in sensitive domains like mental health. While the implementation is relatively straightforward, the well-documented solution provides a solid foundation that could be extended with more features and capabilities in the future.
