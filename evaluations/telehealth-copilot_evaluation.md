# Telehealth Copilot - Evaluation

## Project Overview

The Telehealth Copilot submission consists of a comprehensive telehealth platform that integrates Agora's Conversational AI Engine with medical diagnostic capabilities. The application is designed to:

1. Enable secure video consultations between doctors and patients using Agora RTC
2. Provide real-time AI-powered diagnosis assistance using OpenAI's GPT model
3. Support multiple languages including English, Spanish, and Chinese
4. Generate automatic transcription of consultations
5. Visualize potential diagnoses with interactive charts
6. Incorporate a custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for enhanced patient context

The project consists of a Next.js frontend application and a separate custom LLM wrapper service for handling the RAG functionality and optimizing JSON responses.

## Scoring Details

### 1. Innovation

**Score: 5**

The project demonstrates very innovative approach to complete ai assisted telehealth video-appointment solution. The AI-powered diagnostic assistance via a custom RAG system. The combination of real-time video consultations with dynamic medical analysis, visualization of potential diagnoses, and multilingual capabilities presents a novel approach to conversational AI in healthcare that solves critical problems in remote medical consultations.

### 2. Functionality

**Score: 5**

The code and implementation are clean/clear and the feature set is relatively robust/complete. The core video consultationis feature complete, the AI diagnosis assistant delivers responsive visualization updates based on the conversationa and the RAG system. The multilingual support and transcription features help showcase Agora's utility in real-world scenarios.

### 3. Technical Execution

**Score: 4**

The code quality is very good, it's well-structured. The RAG implementation with vector embeddings shows technical sophistication. Functionaly it has all the elements required plus some nice extras.

Improvements:

- Use the Agora React SDK instead of trying to re-create the logic
- Follow best practices, there should be no reason for setting a timeout in a `user-published`/`client.subscribe` flow. the code is redundant. (using the React SDK would alleviate the need for this hack)

### 4. Documentation & Testing

**Score: 5**

The documentation provides a good overview of the project with setup instructions and environment variables. The README files for both the main app and the custom LLM wrapper clearly explain the configuration and run requirements.

In the demo video, the use of two conversational AI bots in the same channel is an interesting approach to testing the real-time conversational ai. While not required, a "nice-to-have" is a guide on how to use Conversational AI for testing in audio channels.

### 5. User Experience

**Score: 5**

The application provides a clean, intuitive interface with clear role separation (doctor/patient) and logical workflow. The multilingual support, dynamic diagnosis visualization, and AI-powered suggestions create a comprehensive experience.

### 6. Real-World Impact

**Score: 5**

The business use-case is clear for applications in healthcare systems, private practices, and telemedicine platforms. The project addresses a critical real-world need for accessible, "intelligent" telehealth solutions.

The multilingual capabilities expand its potential impact as a demo ac. The integration of AI diagnostic assistance with human medical expertise creates a powerful combination that could improve healthcare outcomes while maintaining the human element of medical care.

## Bonus Point

**Score: +0**

This projects doesnt use any other Agora products.

## Total Score

**Final Score: 4.8/5**

## Feedback

The Telehealth Copilot submission demonstrates an excellent application of Agora's conversational AI capabilities in a healthcare context. The combination of video consultations with AI-powered diagnostic assistance, multilingual support, and patient history integration creates a comprehensive solution with significant real-world potential.

In the demo video, the use of two conversational AI bots in the same channel is an interesting approach to testing the real-time conversational ai.

### Strengths

- Excellent showcase of Agora Convo AI with integration of custom LLM with RAG
- Great technical implementation
- Real-world use-case of RAG and tools that could support Doctors during telehealth visits.
- Multilingual support shows accessibility across diverse populations

### Areas for Improvement

- The VideoCall component should use Agora React SDK instead of Web SDK directly
- Testing instructions and scenarios could be more comprehensive to show how to invite agent for testing.
