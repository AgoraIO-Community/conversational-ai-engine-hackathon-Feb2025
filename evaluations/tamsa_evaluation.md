# Tamsa Team - Evaluation

## Project Overview

The Tamsa submission is a two-player Battleship game that integrates Agora's Conversational AI Engine with RTC capabilities. The project includes:

1. A web-based Battleship game using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Integration of Agora Web SDK for RTC (real-time communication) between players
3. AI agents that listen to player commands via voice and execute game moves
4. AWS Lambda functions for agent management (join/stop)
5. Audience mode allowing viewers to observe games and hear player/agent interactions

## Scoring Details

### 1. Innovation

**Score: 4**

The project demonstrates good creativity by combining Agora's RTC and Conversational AI capabilities in a multiplayer game context. While battleship games are common, the integration of AI agents that respond to voice commands for game moves is a unique approach.

### 2. Functionality

**Score: 4**

The submission demonstrates solid functionality, integrating multiple systems:

- Agora RTC for video/audio communication between players
- Conversational AI agents that listen for specific player commands
- Game state synchronization between players
- Audience mode for spectators

The implementation has most features fully functional, with some limitations noted in audience view (board synchronization issues mentioned in the README). The core gameplay works well with both manual clicks and voice command options.

### 3. Technical Execution

**Score: 3**

The code quality is decent with a functional implementation of Agora services. The project uses vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling, resulting in a single large HTML file containing all game logic, UI, and API integrations. While this approach works, it lacks the separation of concerns that would improve maintainability.

The Lambda functions for agent management are appropriately implemented but provided only as zip files without viewable source. The Agora integration works but the codebase could benefit from better structure and organization.

### 4. Documentation and Ease of Testing

**Score: 2**

The documentation is minimal with basic setup instructions and usage notes. The README provides an overview of the game mechanics and features but lacks:

- Detailed technical architecture explanation
- Clear explanation of the Agora Conversational AI implementation
- Comprehensive setup instructions for local development
- Explanation of the Lambda functions' structure and purpose

The project includes a live demo link, which helps with testing, but the lack of detailed documentation makes it difficult to understand the full implementation or extend the project.

### 5. User Experience

**Score: 3**

The game provides a functional user experience with a clean interface using Tailwind CSS. The gameplay flow is straightforward, allowing users to start or join games and place ships before beginning combat. The voice command feature adds an interesting dimension to the gameplay.

However, there are some usability challenges:

- Reliance on keyboard commands (press 'U' for agent messages) rather than accessible UI controls
- Limited feedback for voice command status/recognition
- Some confusing game state transitions

### 6. Real-World Impact

**Score: 4**

The project has real-world applications beyond its demonstration value. It showcases the integration of Agora's technologies in a game setting as an accessible tool. It could serve as an educational example for Agora SDK integration in other games to provide a voice-controlled experience.

## Bonus Point

**Score: +1**

The team effectively incorporates multiple Agora technologies, using both RTC for player communication and the Conversational AI Engine for voice commands, demonstrating broader platform knowledge.

## Total Score

**Final Score: 4.05/5**

## Feedback

The Tamsa team has created an interesting demonstration of Agora's capabilities in a gaming context. The battleship game with voice-controlled moves shows how conversational AI can be integrated into interactive experiences.

### Strengths

- Successful integration of multiple Agora technologies (RTC, Conversational AI)
- Clean UI implementation with Tailwind CSS
- Working multiplayer functionality with audience mode
- Creative application of AI agents for game control via voice

### Areas for Improvement

- **Code organization**: Separating the single large HTML file into modular components would improve maintainability
- **Documentation**: More comprehensive technical documentation would help others understand the implementation
- **Error handling**: Better feedback for users when voice commands aren't recognized
- **Accessibility**: Adding more visible UI controls rather than relying on keyboard shortcuts
- **Architecture explanation**: Providing more insight into how the Lambda functions and Agora services interact

### Additional Comments

This project successfully demonstrates the integration of Agora's technologies in an interactive game setting. With some improvements to code organization and documentation, it could serve as a valuable reference for developers looking to implement similar voice-controlled multiplayer experiences.

The audience mode is a nice addition that showcases the versatility of Agora's RTC capabilities, though the noted synchronization issues should be addressed. The project shows promise as an educational tool for demonstrating real-time communication and AI integration in web applications.
